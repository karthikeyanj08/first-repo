        </div>
        <p>
            A resort (North American English) is a self-contained commercial establishment that tries to provide most of a vacationer's wants, such as food, drink, swimming, lodging, sports, entertainment, and shopping, on the premises. 
             The term resort may be used for a hotel property that provides an array of amenities, 
            typically including entertainment and recreational activities.
              A hotel is frequently a central feature of a resort, such as the Grand Hotel at Mackinac Island, Michigan.

                In previous centuries, very large homes often featured a great hall. This room was so named because it was very large, regardless of any excellence in it. 
                It was originally a public room and most likely seen in the main home of a noble estate.
